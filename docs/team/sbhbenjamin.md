### Project: Harmonia

**Overview**

Harmonia is a command-line-based personal task manager, which helps university students to manage their academic tasks. It is written in Java and has a GUI implemented with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

**Improved GUI:** [#203](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/pull/203)
- Created initial high-fidelity wireframes on Figma
- Tweaked padding, fonts, colours and alignments according to initial wireframes to make the GUI more pleasing to look at
- Enhanced responsiveness of the application, to ensure that the application displays content as intended at all screen sizes

**Evolved Addressbook into Harmonia:** [#100](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/pull/100)
- Add new `Task` class and its corresponding property classes (`Name`, `Description`, `Tags`, `isCompleted`)
- Add `Deadline` property
- Add `Task` exceptions
- Modify `Addressbook` into a `TaskList`
- Update User Preferences
- Update`Model`

**Added the Priority feature:** [#153](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/pull/153)
- What it does: a feature that allows the user to attach priorities to tasks
- Justification: This feature enhances the product as it allows a user to tag attach an importance to their task, to ensure that they can quickly prioritise what they want to do
- Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands such as `Add`, `Edit`, `Find` and `Sort` commands.

**Conducted testing:**
- Tests for the model [#147](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/pull/147)
- Tests for the `Task` and its properties (`Completion Status`, `Deadline`, `Description`, `Name`, `Task`, `NameContainsKeywordsPredicateTest`, `UniqueTaskListTest`)
- Tests for `TaskList` and `ModelManager`
- Tests for `Tag` [#271](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/pull/271)
